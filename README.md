CISC 4/681 Programming Assignment 2


Sudoku is a number puzzle set on a 9 × 9 grid. The puzzle involves placing a digit in each cell - a
solution having the property that each row, column, and each of the nine 3 × 3 non-overlapping
subgrids (boxes) contains all of the digits 1 thru 9. A puzzle is defined by a partially filled out
grid, and the solver must fill in the missing numbers. See Figure 1 for an example puzzle, and
Figure 2 for its solution.
